    <h1>The Best Movies According To Dewanshu Baijal</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Rockstar (2011)</h3>
    <p>
      An Indian hindi movie with wonderful songs that have depth in them. Movie
      is about a struggling singer who is hustling to find his way but is not
      able to succeed. It has sense of spirituality and connection with the
      divine power. Movie also has depiction of senses and a lesson that
      everything is meant to happen when it is destined to be.

    <h3>Do Lafzon ki Kahani</h3>
    <p>
      Again an Indian film starring one of the best actor Randeep Hooda is a
      romantic film about a boxer who used to do odd jobs to make his ends meet.
      He used to do life or other side type of street fights for money. This
      Movie has a sense of destiny when that guy unknowingly is responsible for
      making a girl blind, they both meet again after years without knowing
      their past and get fall in love with each other. Guy was working for money
      only because of this girl after knowing that he was responsible for her
      lost eyes as he wanted her eyes back which in the end he succeded but
      after a extremely tough journey through.

    <h3>Joker (2019)</h3>
    <p>
      An iconic oscar winning film starring one of the acting greats Joaquin
      Phoenix. This movie depicts the harsh realities of life showing the person
      with the loudest laugh and a person who try .. try hard to bring smile on
      people's faces in public is the same person who used to cry deeply when
      alone. Truly a heartouching film. It's so easy to bully someone but we
      might not know what the person is going through and a little trigger
      negatively could put them in life of death situation turning on the wild
      in them as if 'either the person will stay or me'. A must watch for the
      people who take pride in insulting and who still have some part of the
      heart left.
